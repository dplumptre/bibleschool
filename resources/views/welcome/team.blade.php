He holds a degree in petroleum engineering and worked for 12 years with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) until his voluntary retirement in 1994 to concentrate on the ministry God had committed to him.

Among his initiatives are: Discovery for Men, Discovery for Women, The Woman Leader, Home Affairs and Grace Springs Medical Centre.
An accomplished author, he has to his credit over 300 publications, including books, articles, seminar papers, etc. His books Unleash Your God-given Potential, Created for Blessing, Limitless, 100 Nuggets of Wisdom for the Man of Significance (Volumes 1&2), Home Affairs and The Portrait of a Champion have gained a wide readership both locally and internationally.
He was the husband of the legendary Pastor ‘Bimbo (of blessed memory) and they had three lovely children – a boy and two girls. He is now married to Simangele Rosemary Zulu (popularly known as Pastor Nomthi).
